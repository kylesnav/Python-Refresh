## Projects
**[test.py](test.py):** Hello world.

**[filelist.py](filelist.py):** Creates a tree of every file on your hard drive (MacOS) and saves that file to the desktop.

**[getpics.py](getpics.py):** Scrapes images from a website, navigating through the domain recursively, saving the images on a folder on the desktop.

**[babyflask.py](babyflask.py):** A simple two page Flask website based on HTML/CSS from ChatGPT.

**[getpicsweb.py](getpicsweb.py):** A web-based version of GetPics.py that displays the images on a web page rather than saving them locally (slow on large sites, will probably remove recursion).

**[hellogpt.py](hellogpt.py):** Simple experimentation with the OpenAI API. Takes in a basic prompt, returns simple completion.

**[xwordsorless.py](xwordsorless.py):** An article summarizer built using OpenAI's API and DaVinci003 model. Takes in a desired maximum wordcount and article URL, then returns a summary of the article under the desired word count.
