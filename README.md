<li><b>filelist.py:</b> Creates a tree of every file on your hard drive (MacOS) and saves that file to the desktop.</li>
<li><b>getpics.py:</b> Scrapes images from a website, navigating through the domain recursively, saving the images on a folder on the desktop.</li>
<li><b>babyflask.py:</b> A simple two page Flask website based on HTML/CSS from ChatGPT.</li>
<li><b>getpicsweb.py:</b> A web-based version of GetPics.py that displays the images on a web page rather than saving them locally (slow on large sites, will probably remove recursion).</li>

<li><b>xwordsorless.py:</b> An article summarizer built using OpenAI's API and DaVinci003 model. Takes in a desired maximum wordcount and article URL, then returns a summary of the article under the desired word count.</li>
